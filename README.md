### Software engineer and database geek

I am enthusiast about writing software and solving problems. Iâ€™ve worked with big, busy and highly available systems and services. I in particular enjoy sharing my solutions with the world via blogging (http://code.openark.org/blog/) and via open source.

I author or authored a bunch of open source projects:

- [orchestrator](https://github.com/openark/orchestrator)
- [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost)
- [freno](https://github.com/github/freno)
- [common_schema](https://github.com/shlomi-noach/common_schema)
- [ccql](https://github.com/github/ccql)
- [zookeepercli](https://github.com/outbrain/zookeepercli)
- and some more.
