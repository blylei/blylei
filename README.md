### Python 

I am enthusiast about writing software and solving problems. Iâ€™ve worked with big, busy and highly available systems and services. I in particular enjoy sharing my solutions with the world via blogging (https://blog.blylei.tech/) and via open source.

I author or authored a bunch of open source projects:

- [frabit](https://github.com/frabitech/frabit)
- [frabit-web](https://github.com/frabitech/frabit-web)
- [frabit-server](https://github.com/frabitech/frabit-server)
- [frabit-toolkit](https://github.com/frabitech/frabit-toolkit)
